\title{Load Unvalidated Promotions Data}
\usage{
load_unvalidated_promotions(
  subfolder = c("edges", "nodes", "network"),
  data_dir,
  open_html = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{subfolder}{Which subfolder to load: "edges", "nodes", or "network".}

\item{data_dir}{Path to root unvalidated promotions directory (e.g., "~/cmap_data/dataset/promotions/unvalidated").}

\item{open_html}{Optional: name of .html file to open from the network folder (e.g., "EUROPE_finance.html").}
}
\value{
For "edges" or "nodes": dataframe (tibble) with unvalidated promotion data. For "network": list of available HTML files (invisible if opening one).
}
\description{
Loads statistically inferred promotion data from the specified folder containing region/sector-specific job movement CSVs.
Supports loading "edges" (job movements with inference metrics) and "nodes" (title frequencies per region/sector).
Optionally lists and opens sector-region network .html files for interactive visualization.
}
\details{
Edges: Promotion movements with inference metrics (EPS, JSS, EPDR, promotion_prob).  
Nodes: Job title frequencies by region/sector.  
Network: Interactive HTML sector-region visualization files.  
See README in the dataset for column details and methodology.
}
\examples{
# Load all unvalidated promotion edges (job movements)
unvalidated_edges <- load_unvalidated_promotions("edges", "~/cmap_data/dataset/promotions/unvalidated")
# Load all unvalidated title nodes
unvalidated_nodes <- load_unvalidated_promotions("nodes", "~/cmap_data/dataset/promotions/unvalidated")
# List available network HTML files
unvalidated_networks <- load_unvalidated_promotions("network", "~/cmap_data/dataset/promotions/unvalidated")
# Open a specific sector-region network visualization
load_unvalidated_promotions("network", "~/cmap_data/dataset/promotions/unvalidated", open_html = "EUROPE_finance.html")
