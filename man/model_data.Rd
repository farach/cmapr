\title{CMap Career Mobility Data}
\format{
A tibble with N rows and M columns. The main columns include:
\describe{
  \item{job_title_from}{Source job title for the transition (character).}
  \item{job_title_to}{Destination job title for the transition (character).}
  \item{transition_count}{Number of times this job-to-job transition occurs in the raw promotion data (numeric).}
  \item{job_count_in_sector}{Number of times the job appears in the specialization index (sector-specific count, numeric).}
  \item{transition_weighted_count}{Weighted or normalized count of transitions from the promotions data (numeric).}
  \item{job_weighted_count_in_sector}{Weighted or normalized count of job title occurrences in the specialization index (numeric).}
  \item{promotion_probability}{Estimated probability of promotion for this job-to-job transition (numeric between 0 and 1).}
  \item{region}{Region where the transition occurred (factor/character).}
  \item{sector}{Sector code or name for the job (factor/character).}
  \item{validated}{Indicator for whether the transition was validated (logical/factor).}
  \item{si_from}{Specialization Index for the source job (numeric).}
  \item{se_from}{Sector Exclusivity for the source job (numeric).}
  \item{sd_from}{Sector Dominance for the source job (numeric).}
  \item{weighted_freq_from}{Weighted frequency for the source job (numeric).}
  \item{si_to}{Specialization Index for the destination job (numeric).}
  \item{se_to}{Sector Exclusivity for the destination job (numeric).}
  \item{sd_to}{Sector Dominance for the destination job (numeric).}
  \item{weighted_freq_to}{Weighted frequency for the destination job (numeric).}
  \item{si_difference}{Difference in specialization index (destination - source).}
  \item{sd_difference}{Difference in sector dominance (destination - source).}
  \item{popularity_difference}{Difference in weighted frequency (destination - source).}
  \item{education_progression_score}{Data-derived score for educational progression (numeric).}
  \item{job_start_score}{Data-derived score for starting a new job (numeric).}
  \item{upward_mobility}{Indicator if the promotion probability is high (binary/int).}
  \item{career_stagnation}{Indicator if the promotion probability is low (binary/int).}
  \item{job_hopping_potential}{Indicator if the transition suggests high job hopping (binary/int).}
  \item{source_file}{File path of the source data (character).}
